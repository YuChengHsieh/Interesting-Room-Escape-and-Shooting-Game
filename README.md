# Interesting Room Escape and Shooting Game
You are a Kinopio that was shot into a house by enemies. You have to control the character to collect jet pieces (similar to
room escape games) to assemble a jet. Then, you have to use the jet to combat the enemies (like a shooting game). 
We have recently developed a website for the game, which can be accessed at the following URL: https://yuchenghsieh.github.io/intro_programming_website

## Game Background
The evil Greenlings have attacked the Mushroom Elves' village, and Kinopio's spaceship has been destroyed by the Greenlings as well. Upon awakening, he discovers that he has inadvertently fallen into a mysterious space where he finds hidden spaceship parts. Kinopio must find a way to reassemble the spaceship and defeat the Greenlings to save the villageÔºÅ

## Game Type
In the earlier stages, players will solve simple puzzles to find the required number of spaceship parts. Once they have collected enough parts, they can assemble the spaceship (the quantity of fragments will determine the strength of the spaceship). After successful assembly, players will enter a shooting game to battle the Greenlings, consisting of two levels: the first level featuring minor enemies and the second level featuring a boss battle.

## Game Function
In the earlier stages where the protagonist collects parts, players can navigate through various scenes with different music upon scene transitions. Interactions with NPCs and activating mechanisms provide players with clues to successfully gather the parts. The top of the screen keeps a record of collected parts, and once a specific quantity is reached, players can proceed to the assembly station to build the spaceship and embark on their mission. Different quantities of parts will result in spaceships of varying strength. Both enemy and player characters have health bars, and both sides can shoot bullets. Successfully defeating all enemies and the boss before depleting the player's health bar leads to a victorious outcome.

## Game Scene

### Room Escape Game
The Room Escape game consists of four distinct scenes: the Introduction, Bathroom, Lobby, and Kitchen. In each of these scenes, you must interact with various elements in the background to retrieve the missing piece of a UFO.
