# Interesting Room Escape and Shooting Game
You are a Kinopio that was shot into a house by enemies. You have to control the character to collect jet pieces (similar to
room escape games) to assemble a jet. Then, you have to use the jet to combat the enemies (like a shooting game). 
We have recently developed a website for the game, which can be accessed at the following URL: https://yuchenghsieh.github.io/intro_programming_website
